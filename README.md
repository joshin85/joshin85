# Hello Planet!

I'm Shinjo, one of the people that you share the earth with, I was told to make this README for myself... which I'm not really comfortable with (still trying to figure things out), but here goes

## Setting up local environment
*TODO: start using Docker

1. GOTO home dir
```
cd ~/Palo Alto
```

2. Install university
```
apt-get install san-jose-state-university computer-science
```

3. Start working
```
git clone hpe-fullstack
touch 'api development'
git add .
git commit -m 'working in PHP, NODE, REACT'
```

4. Become an SRE
```
rm -rf hpe-fullstack
ssh sre@linkedin.com
```

You should now have a fully running Shinjo
