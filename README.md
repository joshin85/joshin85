# Hello Planet!

I'm Shinjo, one of the people that you share the earth with, I was told to make this README for myself... which I'm not really comfortable with (still trying to figure things out), but here goes

## Setting up local environment
*TODO: start using Docker

1. GOTO home dir
```bash
$ cd ~/Palo Alto
```

2. Install university
```bash
$ apt-get install san-jose-state-university computer-science
```

3. Start working
```bash
$ git clone hpe-fullstack
$ touch 'api development'
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'working in PHP, NODE, REACT'
```

4. Become an SRE
```bash
$ rm -rf hpe-fullstack
$ ssh sre@linkedin.com
```

5. Move to meta
```bash
$ exit
$ ssh pe@meta.com
$ apt get install ads-ml
```

You should now have a fully running Shinjo (feel free to open a PR if things aren't working)
